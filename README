Place all files in ~/marble/scripts
Add this directory to your path for easy execution.
The scripts expect the catkin workspace in ~/catkin.  Find and replace if named differently.

Quickstart with default setup (4 separate terminals, but can run all in one if desired):

>> marble start
>> marble map
>> marble multiagent
>> marble explore_frontier

If a robot needs a nudge:

>> roskeys X1


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start the basic scenario in the cave environment:

>> marble start

This starts Ignition, loads the environment, two robots and the base station, comms, and RVIZ.

To stop all nodes (including others started manually as below):

>> marble stop

This can be done in the terminal you ran from, even though text is scrolling by.  Or run from another terminal.

To use other environments use:

>> marble start urban
or
>> marble start tunnel

To use a different map than the default, add to the command such as:

>> marble start cave simple_cave_01


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default map merging and multiagent do run at startup, but can be uncommented.  To run separately:

>> marble map
>> marble multiagent

Each can be stopped separately as well:

>> marble stop map
>> marble stop multiagent


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start guidance:

>> marble explore_frontier

To stop guidance without stopping the rest of the simulation:

>> marble stop explore_frontier


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To move a robot manually:

>> roskeys X1

Where X1 can be X1, X2, etc.


-----UNSUPPORTED-----

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use beacons, change enable_beacons to 1 in the marble file.  Currently, the robots_ign.launch will need to be edited to enable the _control for each beacon, and they need to be added to the ign launch line in 'marble', which may or may not work!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use 4 robots, run marble4 and edit the associated files.  This is currently only partially supported with Gazebo.
